# QueensSolver

The 8-Queens problem is to find a way to place 8 queens on a chess board such that none of the queens are attacking each other. This program uses an algorithm to solve the problem in Python.

findQueensSlow is the first function used to solve the problem. It approaches the problem with a depth-first-search method, placing one queen on each file and finding a good place where it is not attacked before moving to the next file. If a queen cannot find a safe space in its file, it will back up and adjust preceding queens.

findQueensFast is yet to be coded. I will be needing to read up on other methods.
